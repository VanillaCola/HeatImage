HeatImage
=========
My name is Jiyuan Li, and I am an Undergraduate Student from University of Utah. This project was proposed by Dr. Feifei Li, a 
Professor from the School of Computing at University of Utah.

Description:
This project is a web-based project, and a large portion of the code was developed under PHP, HTML. The method of generating 
Heatmap comes from a Javascript library which is called Heatmap.js (http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/).

Function1: Generates a Heatmap on an uploaded image.

Function2: Generates an Heatmap animation on an uploaded image to show the dynamic data.

Notice: Now the datasets has been provided are size-fixed, and they can't be either modfied or uploaded. A great idea to improve
this, is to add an account management feature, so that users can upload their own dataset and image at same time as their 
preference. I would add this in the future.
